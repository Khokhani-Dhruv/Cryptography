# Cryptography
In this project, We have tried to design a new Cryptosystem based
on some tree properties (specifically using **LCA(Least Common Ancestor)**) while doing encryption. (Note: LCA of two nodes is the
node that is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both the given
nodes as descendants.)
<br />
• It’s a kind of block cipher but, here we will take a bunch of 2-2 elements and then we will encrypt them respectively.
<br />
• It is a symmetric Cryptosystem (where same key can be used to encrypt and decrypt the message), with encryption key changes in each
step.
